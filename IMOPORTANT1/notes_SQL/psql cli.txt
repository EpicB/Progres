PSQL CLI COMMNADS

\copy (select * from table_name << whatever expresion works)  to 'location/speciffilename.csv' delimiter ',' CSV HEADER;

\l will list all the databases 

\c dbname will connect you to that database 

\d list all the tables in the database

\d name_of_table will show info about the table 

\i [filename] allows you to excute commands from a file 

SQL COMMANDS
CREATE DATABASE dbname; creates a database 

DROP DATABASE dbname; deletes a database ( NEVER USE )

CREATE table test (
   unames varchar(16) Primary key,
    age integer CHECK(age > 14),
   first varchar(64) NOT NULL,
   last varchar (64) NOT NULL
);

DROP TABLE table_name; removes the table with all of its data ( NEVER USE )

select column_name from table_name; selects that column and shows it 

you can use (order by) keyword

select column_name from table_name ORDER BY column_name desc ; by default its acssending order add asc or desc after column name

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp"; // can be used to add an extension 

select distinct column_name from table_name order by column_name; this will get you all the data but not repeated 

where can used to apply conditions on the select statment returns true or false

LIMIT --- >  select * from table_name limit 5; --- i only want to see the first 5 rows

fetch --- > select * from data_random fetch first n row only;

<> not equal operator other operations 
IN KEYWORD --- > select * from table_name where country_of_birth in("data1","data2","data3"); it does 3 matches
and in a plpgsql for loop loops 3 times over all the data in the string

DATE IS A SQL FUNCTION can be used as follows -- 
YYYY-MM-DD
select * from table_name where date_of_birth between DATE '2001-02-03' and '2003-03-03';
 
BETWEEN --- > select * from test_random where id between 1 and 3 ; give me the id from 1 to 3 

like --- > select * from test_random where email like '%@google.%'; give me all the emails that are google emails that end
with w/e 

SELECT * from test_random where email like '_____@%'; give me all the emails that has 6 charachers before the @ 
% represents anything 
_ represents 1 character

ILIKE --- > keyword same as like keyword the only difference is that it ignores the case p or P same thing

Group by --- > select country , function() group by country; take that function and apply it to the column based on how 

having is like where but you can use functions with it so when using group by if you compare a function value 
you should use having 

agregarte function 

select min(column_name) from table_name ;
select round(max(column_name)) from table_name ;


select gender , count(*) from test_random group by gender having count(*) > 30;
its grouped  



arthmatic operations example 
select id ,make , model, price , round(price * .10 ,2), round (price - ( price*.10 ),2) from table_name


select Coalesce(email, 'email not provided ') from table_name; if the emnail is null show it as email not provided 

select NOW(); ---- returns the time 
select NOW()::DATE; ---- you can gather the date 
select NOW()::TIME; ---- you can gather the time with MS

select extract(year from now()); this will return the actual year ---- ( month and day and dow and century )

age function 


select first_name , last_name , date_of_birth ,age(now(),date_of_birth) as age from table_name;

delete from table_name where = "id"; ALWAYS SPECIFY A WHERE CLASUE if you dont its going to delete everything

update from table_name set coulmn_name = "soemthing",coulmn_name = "something" where ="id"; IF YOU DONT SPECIFY A WHERE CLAUSE EVERYTHING GETS UPDATED


ON CONFLICT (id) do nothing 
if you wanna handle an error you can use the 
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET email = ECLUDED.email; if a column has unique and you got an id conflict you can exclude the update on that
value

DATE \\ this is a data type uses the date structure to when inserting to data example

insert into table_name (date_of_birth) values (DATE '1988-01-20')


insert into test_random (id , first_name , last_name , email, gender,date_of) values(1022,'a','a','asdasdas@gmail.com,Femail,'2001-01-01');
